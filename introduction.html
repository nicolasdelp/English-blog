            <h1 class="uk-article-title">Introduction</h1>
            
            <p>The car has been part of our daily lives for decades, it is more and more accessible and is therefore more and more present on our roads. Cars are constantly evolving and becoming more connected and assisted by artificial intelligence.</p>
                
            <p>In the 21st century, the automobile is moving from internal combustion engines to electric engines (or their alternatives). Such a significant change implies new research and progress in the field. Whether it is for autonomous driving, the use of new energies, or new ways of storing this energy. The transport of some new sources of energy can pose certain safety problems, so new processes must also be found to transport it as safely as possible. The great challenge of this period is to offer an alternative to the fuel engine as oil becomes scarce.</p>
            
            <p>Autonomous driving will allow safer driving but also less energy-consuming driving because it will be optimised. Autonomous driving is the solution to severely reduce the number of deaths on the roads too. A car driven by a computer will make almost no mistakes, unlike a human being.</p>
        
            <p>The transition must be gradual because not all infrastructures are able to support so many vehicles at the moment. (e.g. the number of charging stations)</p>
